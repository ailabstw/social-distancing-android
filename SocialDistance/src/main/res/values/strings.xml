    <string name="introduction_family_description">The Taiwan Social Distancing App was developed by the Taiwan AI Labs in cooperation with the Executive Yuan and the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control in order to reduce the likelihood of disease transmission and keep people safe.</string>
    <string name="introduction_privacy_title">Privacy and Data Protection</string>
    <string name="introduction_privacy_description">Taiwan Social Distancing App use is anonymous - users do not need to register and no user data will be collected. The only form of data transmission involved is the observation of Bluetooth signals between handheld devices to calculate the distance between each user.\n\nUser privacy will be ensured via decentralized storage of anonymous IDs for individual devices; contact data will be compiled by each respective device.</string>
    <string name="introduction_intro_title">Reduce the Spread of Pandemic</string>
    <string name="introduction_intro_description">Users who have tested positive can choose to anonymously publish their device\'s anonymous IDs. When users with a positive test publish their results, people who have been in proximity to this device and maintained contact for a certain period of time will receive a notification. This process guarantees the anonymity and personal privacy of those who share their positive test results while contributing to keeping our communities informed and diligent in taking preventative and cautionary measures.</string>
